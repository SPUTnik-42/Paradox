## Distinctiveness and Complexity
>
>This project is different from any of the previous projects, it is made for in an entirely new genre of websites ,i.e a type of quiz website where the user and the website give input and react in real time. This project was insiped by the lack of python based websites in our school technology club, although it is primarily made for CS50 but it is ready for deployment for real world use. It never can be categorized under the bracket of the previous projects submitted
>
>This project uses more than 5 tables in the database, with more than three interconnected fields and tables, it includes more than 8 views in the app directory and has adequate number of html and css files. Most of the backend is in python or the django template language.The authentication and registration is fully secured using hashed passwords and other security measures.
